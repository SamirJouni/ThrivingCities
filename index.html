            <span>A 79-year Memphis tradition, Peabody Rooftop Parties take place every Thursday night,
              April 12 – August 16, 6pm – 10pm. Weekly admission is $10 - $15 and ladies get in free before 7pm.
              The parties are hosted by Q107.5 FM and DJ Epic. Each week features a snack buffet and drink specials
              from Rooftop Party beverage sponsors.</span>
              <p class="eventDescriptionTitle eventsPadding dontDisplayInitially dontDisplay">About the Peabody Hotel:</p>
              <p class="locationDetails dontDisplayInitially dontDisplay">Peabody Rooftop Parties feature live music from top local and regional entertainment acts and occasional national touring acts. The Peabody and Q107.5 FM have surprised partiers every season with special guest performances by rising stars with current radio hits, such as Noah Cyrus, Mike Posner, David Cook, American Authors, Icona Pop, Shaggy, Hot Chelle Rae, Capital Cities, Neon Trees, Boys Like Girls, Katy Tiz, Owl City, Carly Rae Jepsen, MKTO, Finger Eleven, Matt Nathanson, Parmalee, Andy Grammar, and Shinedown.

              The tradition of parties on the roof of The Peabody Hotel began more than 75 years ago when the east end of the hotel's roof was enclosed in 1939, creating the Peabody Rooftop and adjoining Art Deco-styled Skyway ballroom. Originally called Sunset Serenades, the parties in the new supper club became a huge success, featuring performances by showbiz greats of the era such as Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Chuck Foster, Lawrence Welk, George Hamilton, and the Andrews Sisters. During the 1940s, the Skyway was one of just three national live radio broadcast sites for Big Band dances on CBS Radio. One such weekly program was hosted by a young Sam Phillips, from 1945 to 1950, before he launched Sun Records.</p>
